# playing-with-perceptron

a simple neural network, which aims to make the decision to go to an Iron Maiden show based on three simple factors: `i1 = do I have money?, i2 = do i have friends to go to?, i3 = do I have locomotion?` these conditions will have their own weights to balance the decision making, I'll call the weight `w`
